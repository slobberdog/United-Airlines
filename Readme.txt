United Airlines has embarked on a cost analysis audit of their running costs and I have been recruited to generate Power Bi reports as per their request, using Python to extract data from Excel and import and process in SQL tables.

The reports they specifically requested pertain to the costs of salaries and training as a % of their total costs from 1995 to 2015.
